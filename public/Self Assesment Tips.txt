Included in the project is a self-assessment feature. I need some verified data used by mental health professionals to diagnose mental health patients, specifically university students. Provide me with these self-assessment questions and include detailed references as well.
Creating a self-assessment feature for mental health requires using validated and reliable tools that are commonly used by mental health professionals. Below, I’ve provided examples of self-assessment questions based on widely recognized psychological assessments. These tools are often used to screen for common mental health issues among university students, such as depression, anxiety, and stress.
 
1. Depression Self-Assessment (Based on PHQ-9)
The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) is a widely used tool for screening and diagnosing depression.

4. Additional Questions for University Students
You can also include questions tailored to university students, such as:
1. How often do you feel overwhelmed by academic workload?
2. How often do you struggle to balance academic and personal life?
3. How often do you feel isolated or lonely on campus?
4. How often do you feel financially stressed?
5. How often do you feel supported by your peers or university resources?
 
Implementation Tips:
1. Scoring and Feedback:
o Provide users with a summary of their scores and what they mean.
o Offer suggestions for next steps (e.g., "Your score suggests moderate anxiety. Consider speaking with a counsellor or using relaxation techniques.").
2. Privacy and Ethics:
o Ensure users understand their data will be kept confidential.
o Provide resources for immediate help if they score high on any scale.
3. References:
o Always cite the tools and their creators to maintain academic integrity.
